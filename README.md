# Get a Jump Start on your Voyage

## Introduction

Welcome to your Chingu Voyage! Voyages are your opportunity to create a new
web application in a team setting. Gain takes a certain level of pain. Voyages
are hard work, but they are also very rewarding and you will learn more on a
Voyage that you typically can on a solo project. 

Just as importantly, Chingu Voyages create a setting to help you acquire and
practice the skills you will need on the job.

## About this Repo

This your team's repo. The [Wiki]() that's part of this repo can be used as a
quick reference
as you make your way through the Voyage, but you and your team can and should
make whatever modifications you deem necessary to help make your project a 
success. 

Other than this readme and the wiki we've intentionally left this repo blank
so you can put your stamp on it. Treat this as an opportunity to create
something you are proud of and something you can show to prospective employers.

So feel free to add, change, or remove items in this repo - including this
readme.

## Where to Start?

The hardest two segments of any project are project initiation and closure.
However, this repos wiki contains information you'll need to start, run, and
close out your Voyage project.

A good place to start is to carefully read the invitation emails you received
at the start of the Voyage, and then review the contents of your repos wiki.

***Good Luck and Get Started!***
