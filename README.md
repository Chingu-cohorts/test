# Get a Jump Start on your Voyage

## Introduction

Welcome to your Chingu Voyage! Voyages are your opportunity to create a new
web application in a team setting. Gain takes a certain level of pain. Voyages
are hard work, but they are also very rewarding and you will learn more on a
Voyage that you typically can on a solo project. 

Just as importantly, Chingu Voyages create a setting to help you acquire and
practice the *_hard_* and *_soft_* skills you will need on the job.

## About this Repo

This your team's repo. So feel free to add, change, or remove any items it
contains - *_including this readme_*. Other than this readme we've intentionally
left this repo blank so you can put your stamp on it. Treat this as an
opportunity to create something you are proud of and something you can show
to prospective employers.

## The Voyage Wiki

There's also a [Voyage Wiki](https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/voyage-wiki/wiki)
which contains information you'll need as you and progress through the Voyage.
It contains information and suggestions to help you understand what's required,
what your obligations are, how jump start your team's project, and advice on 
how to address different situations that may arise.

This wiki is continuously updated based on input from Chingu teams and the
experiences encountered in each Voyage. 

## Where to Start?

The hardest two segments of any project are project initiation and closure.
The [Voyage Wiki](https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/voyage-wiki/wiki) contains
information to help your team start, run, and close out your Voyage project.

A good place to start is to carefully read the invitation emails you received
at the start of the Voyage, and then review the contents of Voyage Wiki.

***Good Luck and Let's Get Started!***
